Documentation
This script provides a function to optimize and condense Python code. The OptimizationTransformer class defines a series of methods to optimize different types of nodes in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the code, such as variable names, constants, binary operations, string literals, comments, and imports. The condense_code() function takes a string of Python code as input, optimizes it using the OptimizationTransformer, and writes the condensed code to a file specified by the write_to_file argument.

The condense_file() function reads a Python file specified by the filepath argument, passes its content to condense_code(), and writes the optimized code to a new file with the suffix .condensed.

The condense_script() function condenses a string or file of Python code depending on the type of the code_or_file argument. If it is a string, it is passed directly to condense_code(). If it is a file object, its content is read and passed to condense_code(). The optional write_to_file argument specifies the file name to write the condensed code to.

All functions in this script accept file paths and file objects as input, in addition to string inputs.

Python Optimization & Condensor Script:

This is a Python script that condenses and optimizes Python code to make it more concise and efficient. It does this by using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to analyze and transform the code.

Usage
The script can be used in two ways: with a string of code or with a file containing code.

To condense a string of code, call the condense_script function and pass the code as a string argument:

python
Copy code
from code_condenser import condense_script

code = "x = 5\ny = 10\nz = x + y\nprint(z)"
condense_script(code)
This will condense the code and write it to a new file called condensed_code.py in the current directory.

To condense a file containing code, call the condense_file function and pass the file path as an argument:

python
Copy code
from code_condenser import condense_file

file_path = "/path/to/my/code.py"
condense_file(file_path)
This will condense the code in the file and write it to a new file with the same name and a .condensed extension in the same directory as the original file.

You can also specify the name of the file to write to by passing a write_to_file argument:

python
Copy code
from code_condenser import condense_script, condense_file

# condense a string of code and write it to a new file called "my_condensed_code.py"
code = "x = 5\ny = 10\nz = x + y\nprint(z)"
condense_script(code, write_to_file="my_condensed_code.py")

# condense a file and write it to a new file with a custom name
file_path = "/path/to/my/code.py"
condense_file(file_path, write_to_file="/path/to/my/condensed_code.py")
Optimization Transformations
Code Condenser applies several transformations to the code to make it more concise and efficient. These transformations include:

Replacing list comprehensions with generator expressions
Replacing range with xrange
Converting lists and tuples in membership tests to sets
Simplifying for loops with simple assignments and additions
Optimizing variable names by adding a prefix and suffix
Rounding floating point numbers to two decimal places
Optimizing binary operations by rounding floating point numbers
Optimizing string literals by removing newlines and compressing whitespace
Optimizing comments by wrapping long comments to multiple lines and removing trailing whitespace
Removing duplicate imports
Requirements
Code Condenser requires Python 3.6 or later and the ast, re, os, and decimal modules.
